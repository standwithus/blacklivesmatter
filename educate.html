            <p> The Black Lives Matter organization formed in 2013 after the murderer of an innocent young boy, Trayon Martin, was acquitted. The movement spread wide across the US, UK, and Canada where the mission to "eradicate white supremacy" and demand justice resonated among many. But, as we know, racism didn't develop recently. Black people struggle with systemic racism, racism that is embedded within our society and has prevailed for years. Hover over these panels to find out more about institutional racism, injustice within political systems, and how you can educate yourself.

                                Studies have shown that most inherently racist individuals believe they are less racist than the normal person. The reason why many people and institutions seem to 
                                behave in a racist manner without realizing it leads to the concept of institutional racism. Institutional racism is defined as "the systematic distribution of resources, power, and opportunity in our societyto the benefit 
                                of people who are white and the exclusion of people of color." These systems were engrained in society throughout our history of racial stratification, slavery, internment camps...<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrHIQIO_bdQ&feature=youtu.be" > Click here to watch an informative video on systemic racism. </a>

                               Black communities have faced voter suppression and discrimination in the electoral process for hundreds of years. Ironically, our democracy has enforced white hegemony over the years through its politicans and lawmakers. In 2013 Shelby County vs Holder Supreme Court case ruled that in order to challenge discriminatory voting laws, communities had to file suits by themselves, sometimes after the laws were in place. Voting became much more difficult and biased after this. Unfortunately, as COVID-19 disproportionately affects communities of color, there will be even lower black voter turnout and manipulation in this 2020 Presidential Election.
